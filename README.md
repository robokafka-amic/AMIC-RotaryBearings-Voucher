Rotary bearings project 

- Connected via Websocket from Neuron app
  - Needs an end url to connect to websocket
    - Uses Ngrok to create the url
  - The end url needs a local service to run, 
    - Creates a local service using flask which connects to end url / wh websocket
  - The flask service is also connected to a local mqtt broker sending data

  - Create an Arduino micro plc logic that can connect to the mqtt broker and create input values for PLC 
  - PLC connects to any standard lubricator and sends digial input.
